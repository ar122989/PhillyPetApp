Philly Pet App

The purpose of this web app is to help pet owners find any pet that they may have lost.  

There are five basic sections that make up this web app. Links to animal shelters in philadelphia, reporting a found pet, reporting a lost pet, browsing pets that have been reported found and browsing pets that have been reported lost.

In order to report a pet lost or found the user simply fills out a form and submits.  They are even given the option of uploading a photo.

The pages for browsing lost and found pets are simple lists of the pets with the photo and type of pet. Selecting a pet will take the user to another page that gives more details for the pet.

The web app is written using PHP and jQuery Mobile 1.2.1.  The database used to store the data is MySQL.  Included in the zip file is a script that will create the necessary database objects.

To setup this app the server needs to have MySQL and PHP installed.  Log in to MySQL Admin with an account that has admin priveleges and run the provided script. Then all the files (minus the sql script) need to be copied to the root web site folder.  A folder called "Images" needs to be created under the root folder.  The "Images" folder needs to have read and write permissions for the image uploading to work.

This web app will require very little maintanence.  The only thing that needs to be done is to remove old records from the database and their associated images.  I will leave it to the discresion of the web server administrator as to how many records can be kept.

The only author for this web app was me! Ariel De Prada.  You can contact me with any questions at luyikao@gmail.com or on my cell phone 714-381-4517.
